Now, sort all Denmark airports by size, and only CPH (Copenhagen Airport) is big enough to have a gate "B8". The gates in smaller airports are coded only with numbers.

Then find a CPH map and look for Gate B8. Confirm there are indeed male washrooms nearby.

Find all arrivals to CPH. In the metadata we have the picture was taken around 1 pm local time. Find the flight whose duration is slightly shorter than 2 hours, the length of Citizen Kane (the movie mentions the meaning of Rosebud).

We have flight SAS 566 from Paris. The answer is the MD5 hash of "paris".

### Step 2:

Find the Wikipedia page [List_of_shipwrecks_in_1894](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_shipwrecks_in_1894). The only one who meets the criteria is SS Dorunda, shipwrecked on September 27, 1894, in Berlengas, Portugal. 

Now search for new discoveries of snails in this area, and we can find [Oestophora barrelsi](https://www.molluscabase.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=1001335). The answer is the MD5 hash of "oestophorabarrelsi".
