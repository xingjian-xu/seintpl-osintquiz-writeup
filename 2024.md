### Step 1:

Search for the "Herrer Gentlemen" washroom sign, and find that it is Danish or Norwegian. Search for airport signs in Denmark and Norway, and the Danish version matches the design.

Now, sort all Denmark airports by size, and only CPH (Copenhagen Airport) is big enough to have a gate "B8". The gates in smaller airports are coded only with numbers.

Then find a CPH map and look for Gate B8. Confirm there are indeed male washrooms nearby.

Find all arrivals to CPH. In the metadata we have the picture was taken around 1 pm local time. Find the flight whose duration is slightly shorter than 2 hours, the length of Citizen Kane (the movie mentions the meaning of Rosebud).

We have flight SAS 566 from Paris. The answer is the MD5 hash of `paris`.

### Step 2:

Find the Wikipedia page [List of shipwrecks in 1894](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_shipwrecks_in_1894). The only one who meets the criteria is SS Dorunda, shipwrecked on September 27, 1894, in Berlengas, Portugal. 

Now search for new discoveries of snails in this area, and we can find [Oestophora barrelsi](https://www.molluscabase.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=1001335). The answer is the MD5 hash of `oestophorabarrelsi`.

### Step 3:

Search the characters "那智勝浦" on the banner to find the town of [Nachikatsuura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nachikatsuura). Also since the character on the top means "to give" or "to present respectfully" which appears mostly in religious places, we find the shrine [Kumano Nachi Taisha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumano_Nachi_Taisha). We can double-check by finding banners with similar fonts and frames in the street view. 

Now check Google Earth Pro for mountains with similar shapes. Also we can find the exact banner in [this street view](https://www.google.ca/maps/@33.6685216,135.8904149,3a,69.8y,356.7h,82.13t/data=!3m11!1e1!3m9!1sAF1QipPEMoaKVHhnU3O40KjgFELamoaK5DMrYpHdW5JK!2e10!3e11!6shttps:%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipPEMoaKVHhnU3O40KjgFELamoaK5DMrYpHdW5JK%3Dw900-h600-k-no-pi7.867373819137697-ya57.69715321390851-ro0-fo100!7i8704!8i4352!9m2!1b1!2i40?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDEyMi4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D).

Now look around to find a painting of a chicken, near the entrance of the shrine - the street view is taken in a year of chicken. Find the street view taken in the year of snake, and find the characters written next to it as "開運", which means good luck. The answer is the MD5 hash of `goodluck`. 

### Step 4:

Translate "Let's go on a trip to look for magical sounds" to Spanish and take keywords from it to Google. By searching something like `Vamos de viaje "busca" "sonidos mágicos"` we can find the lyric of _Ecuador_ by
Sash! (DJ). So the country is Ecuador.

Search to find that the largest city in Ecuador is Guayaquil. Now go to its [official website](https://www.guayaquil.gob.ec/). Use the Internet Archive to find [the snapshot in 2010](https://web.archive.org/web/20101016065508/https://www.guayaquil.gob.ec/). The telephone number on the bottom of the page is 259-9100. The answer is the MD5 hash of `2599100`.

### Step 5:

First, search the characters written on the wall of the target brown building: "三菱電機体育館", then we know that it is one of the Mitsubishi Electric Gymnasiums in Japan. Now look for names of broader areas in the picture, to locate which one of the gyms is this. We could find "長崎県公安委員会", which means "Nagasaki Prefectural Public Safety Commission". There is only one Mitsubishi Electric Gymnasium in the Nagasaki Prefecture, near a railway station, as seen in the picture as well.

Find the street view of the gym, and on any image after around 2022, we could find the [new logo](https://www.google.ca/maps/@32.7529502,129.864784,3a,15y,208.37h,128.19t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1svupNjE5EC3sctndYGOVGuA!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D-38.185328264680294%26panoid%3DvupNjE5EC3sctndYGOVGuA%26yaw%3D208.36900625277065!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDEyMi4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). The answer is the MD5 hash of `2005nagasaki`.

### Step 6:

First start with the extinct big bird. Looking through the [list of extinct bird species since 1500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_extinct_bird_species_since_1500), and filter out any bird that is 
- too small; or
- not unique to one country.

Listing all the countries with extinct big birds, we have

- New Zealand
- Madagascar
- Russia
- France
- Mauritus
- USA

Now look for the existing 5 unique bird families. Note that most of the countries do not have endemic bird families (well, since birds can fly), mostly endemic to a certain country only happens on islands, with small birds or birds that cannot fly. Only Madagascar has exactly 5. New Zealand has 6, and others don't really have any.

Finally double-check for the "collection of unique primates". Madagascar has indeed many unique primates, including the famous Lemurs. 

The Latin name of the extinct big bird in Madagascar, the Elephant Bird, is "Aepyornis maximus". Thus the answer is the MD5 hash of `aepyornismaximus`.
